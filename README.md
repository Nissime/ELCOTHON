# Alexa... fist me!


This is a readme file for the **smart socket** device that was developed at the Junction and Electra (Alexa) hackathons by ...

## Setup

### Hardware required:

- NodeMCU with ESP-12E module
- 220VAC to 5VDC converter
- 5V relay capable switching 220VAC
- AC current sensor 5A for arduino
- RFID reader
- RFID stickers
- Electricity sockets - male & female
- Jumper wires
- 2x 1KOhm resistor


### Languages used:

- Python 3
- arduino

### TODOs:
1. Add led screen for self IP display
2. Add remote relay switching capabilities (solely a code gap)
3. Improve the AI aspect of the socket
4. Migrate to ESP32 and enable bluetooth
5. Add UI with Kivy ?
6. More and more and more...
